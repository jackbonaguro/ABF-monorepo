          <P>
            <B>002:</B> Man, I really like this.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> Haha, good that you like it. The concept is kind of
            wild, but in some ways the wild creates some seriously interesting
            potential.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> Yea, I can see that. So what's it called?
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> Called <B>ABF</B>. Absolute Brain Fuck. Because you
            know... its an absolute brain fuck.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> We gotta lean into it. ABF only works in absurdity.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> 100%. Every feature/descision of ABF is designed to
            nurture the absurdity. No blockers to enjoying ABF. If you dare to,
            you deserve to.
          </P>
          <P>
            No fees, no whitelist, no NFT access token. Just your wits, and the
            willpower to use it.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> You think alot of people will use ABF?
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> Honestly, no clue the amount of people. But I know there
            will be people who love this stuff. It builds on the small-code
            movement, the on-chain art movement, and has the right meme-nomics.
          </P>
          <P>
            I see it like an artisan, in wood, a wood worker. He or she uses
            powertools, a CNC to perform his/her craft. He or she is good at it.
            But say a client comes around and asks this wood worker to make a
            dining table.
          </P>
          <P>
            The client has one constraint:{' '}
            <B>"No powertools, just handtools"</B>.
          </P>
          <P>
            There will be wood workers who hear that and shivers, and turn it
            down. But I believe there will be wood workers that hears that and
            is titillated.
          </P>
          <P>
            "Hell yea" that wood worker would say. The challenge would not deter
            the passion to the craft. If anything, it brings a completely new
            dimension to it.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> I like that metaphor. I see how ABF is that but for
            generative art.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> Yea, you see these people in different fields. Gamers
            who master speed runs, developers only using ssh + vim, a
            car-mechanic working on restoring a car. Its about the craft, not
            just the product.
          </P>
          <P>
            ABF is that but for all of NFTs. ABF is designed with so many layers
            of modularity + minimalism; it is capable of so many things.
          </P>
          <P>
            With such potential, again, we can't block people. That's why its a
            hyperstructure. That's why we need to let a community organically
            develop.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> The ABF Corp.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> What?
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>002:</B> Thats the name of the community, Corp like the Marine
            Corp, not corporation. A community about the comradre of collective
            brain-fucking.
          </P>
          <P>
            <B>001:</B> I like that. The ABFC. <B>"VIRES IN STRUCTURA"</B>.
            Strength in structures. ABF is a hyper-structure, but so will this
            community.
